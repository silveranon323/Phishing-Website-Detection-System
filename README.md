# Phishing Website Detection

This project is a machine learning-based solution for detecting phishing websites. Phishing websites are designed to deceive users into revealing personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, by masquerading as legitimate websites. This project aims to identify and classify websites as either phishing or legitimate using various machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

Phishing attacks are a significant security threat on the internet. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to detect phishing websites based on their features. By analyzing various aspects of the website, such as URL, HTML content, and metadata, the model can determine the likelihood of a website being a phishing attempt.

## Features

- Extracts and processes features from URLs and HTML content
- Implements multiple machine learning algorithms
- Provides a simple interface for predicting phishing websites
- Evaluates model performance with various metrics

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python libraries: (listed in `requirements.txt`)
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - beautifulsoup4
  - requests
